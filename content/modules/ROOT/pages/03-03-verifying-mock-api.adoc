= 3.3 Verifying the Mock API
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that ArgoCD has successfully deployed the mock API application, let's perform a quick test to ensure it's running and reachable from within the cluster. We will use the built-in OpenShift command line terminal, which provides a convenient way to interact with our project without leaving the web console.

== Accessing the OpenShift Terminal

1.  In the OpenShift web console, make sure you are in the **Developer** perspective and have your project (`rag-pipeline-workshop`) selected.

2.  In the top-right corner of the page, click on the command line terminal icon to open a new terminal session directly in your browser.

3.  A new browser tab will open with a terminal session already logged into your OpenShift account and pointing to your project.

== Testing the API Service

We will now send a request to the API's `/api/v1/health` endpoint. This is a simple way to confirm the application is up and running. The API is exposed internally via a Kubernetes Service named `mock-api` on port `8080`.

1.  In the OpenShift terminal you just opened, copy and paste the following `curl` command and press Enter:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl http://mock-api:8080/api/v1/health
----
+
This command sends an HTTP GET request directly to the internal service endpoint of our mock API.

2.  You should see the following JSON output, indicating that the API is healthy:
+
[source,json]
----
{"status":"UP"}
----

If you see this output, it confirms that:
* The `mock-api` Deployment is running correctly.
* The internal `Service` is properly routing traffic to the application pod.

Now that our data source is ready, we can proceed with deploying the data ingestion pipeline.
