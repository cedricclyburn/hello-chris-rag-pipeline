= 4.1 Advanced RAG with InstructLab
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Congratulations! You have successfully built an end-to-end, event-driven RAG system that ingests data from an API and makes it available for querying. This is a massive step forward for {company-name}.

However, our journey doesn't end here. The current RAG system is powerful, but it has limitations. While it can provide contextually relevant information, the LLM's core behavior, tone, and ability to follow complex instructions remain unchanged.

== The Next Step: From RAG to RAFT
:slide:

The next evolution of our system is to move from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to **Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT)**. This is a powerful technique for creating truly domain-specific, instruction-following models.

* **RAG:** Provides external knowledge to a generic model at the time of the query. It's like giving a smart person an open book during an exam.
* **RAFT:** Uses your curated, high-quality knowledge to *actually teach the model*, fundamentally improving its understanding of your specific domain, terminology, and desired behaviors. It's like having the smart person study the book before the exam.

This is the core principle behind **InstructLab**, a new open-source project for enhancing LLMs with new skills and knowledge in a community-driven way.

== The InstructLab & RAFT Process

The RAFT process, as implemented by InstructLab, involves three key stages:

1.  **Curate Knowledge & Skills:**
    We start by creating a small, high-quality dataset based on our own domain knowledge. For {company-name}, this would involve:
    * **Knowledge:** Selecting the best, most useful incident resolutions from our ServiceNow data.
    * **Skills:** Writing a handful of example question-and-answer pairs that demonstrate the *exact* tone, format, and reasoning we want our IT support assistant to have.

2.  **Generate Synthetic Data:**
    InstructLab takes this small, curated dataset and uses a teacher model to generate a much larger, synthetic dataset of thousands of high-quality instruction-following examples. This synthetically scales our effort.

3.  **Fine-Tune the Model:**
    A Large-scale Alignment and Tuning (LAB) technique is used to efficiently fine-tune a base LLM (like a Granite or Llama model) with the new synthetic dataset. This process is far more efficient than traditional fine-tuning methods.

== The Result: A Truly Enterprise-Ready AI Assistant

By fine-tuning a model using the RAFT method, we create a new model that is not only knowledgeable about our specific ServiceNow data but is also better at:
* **Following Instructions:** Adhering to specific formatting and output requirements.
* **Adopting a Persona:** Consistently behaving like a professional, helpful IT support agent from {company-name}.
* **Improving Accuracy:** Reducing errors and hallucinations by having the domain knowledge more deeply integrated into its own weights.

By swapping out the generic model in our RAG system with this newly fine-tuned model, we create a significantly more capable, reliable, and valuable AI assistant for our company.
